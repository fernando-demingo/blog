	Abstract = {The U.S. Air Force is developing new force capabilities appropriate to an emerging array\nof threats. It is clear that advances in information science and technology (IS&T) are\nessential for most of these new capabilities. As a consequence, the Air Force is finding it\nnecessary to refocus its IS&T basic research program to provide stronger support for\nreaching these goals. To assist this effort, the AFOSR asked the NRC for a study to\ncreate a vision and plan for the IS&T-related programs within the Office\u2019s Mathematics\nand Space Science Directorate. This report provides an assessment of basic research\nneeds for Air Force systems and communications, software, information management and\nintegration, and human interactions with IS&T systems. The report also offers a set of\npriorities for basic IS&T research, and an analysis of funding mechanisms its support.},

	Abstract = {This paper is derived from a keynote address given that the DMS-03 meeting. It chronicles the need and development of next generation networks (NGN) in the United States. Specific organizational examples are derived from the Internet2-Abilene Network. The technical characteristics of a next generation network versus the Internet are discussed. Examples are given from the point of view of the need for a quality of service based network to deliver distributed multimedia healthcare information to the point of need. The concepts of network trust and of a network based scalable information infrastructure for the reliable delivery of distributed multimedia information is also introduced.},

@article{KULPA1977434,
	Abstract = {In picture processing one is often confronted with the problem of deriving some geometrical parameters (e.g., area, perimeter) of continuous figures (blobs, curves) from their digitizations. This paper concerns some particular aspects of this problem, namely, the construction of practical, simple, and computationally fast methods for measuring accurately the area and perimeter of blobs given as digital binary pictures. The analysis of some properties of digital pictures leads to two such methods. The first one uses only local, position-invariant parallel picture processing operations. The second one uses explicit polygonal approximations of the picture contour, with controlled degree of approximation, and can work on more noisy pictures. The methods were practically tested in a working program for shape factor measurement of fiber sections. In addition some useful properties of Freeman's digitization scheme are investigated and proved.},

	Abstract = {The forthcoming wide availability of high bandwidth public wireless networks will give rise to new mobile healthcare services. To this end, the MobiHealth project has developed and trialed a highly customisable vital signs monitoring system based on a body area network (BAN) and a mobile-health (m-health) service platform utilising next generation public wireless networks. The developed system allows the incorporation of diverse medical sensors via wireless connections, and the live transmission of the measured vital signs over public wireless networks to healthcare providers. Nine trials with different healthcare scenarios and patient groups in four different European countries have been conducted. These have been performed to test the service and the network infrastructure including its suitability for mobile healthcare applications. Preliminary results have documented the feasibility of using the system, but also demonstrated logistical problems with use of the BANs and the infrastructure for transmitting mobile healthcare data.},

	Abstract = {MobiHealth1 and HealthService241 are two major EU projects targeting the development and validation, with extensive medical trials, of innovative systems and services for mobile health care. Biosignals are measured by sensor devices connected to a wireless Body Area Network. These signals are transmitted reliably and securely over public wireless networks (e.g. GPRS, UMTS) to a remote healthcare organisation where healthcare professionals can monitor, diagnose and provide advice to patients in real time. The developed system and its services is in the last phase of the pre-commercial validation, expecting a commercial release of the system late 2006.},

	Abstract = {``Know Thyself'' is a motto leading the Quantified Self (QS) movement, which at first originated as a ``hobby project'' driven by self-discovery, and is now being leveraged in wellness and healthcare. QS practitioners rely on the wealth of digital data originating from wearables, applications, and self-reports that enable them to assess diverse domains of their daily life. That includes their physical state (e.g., mobility, steps), psychological state (e.g., mood), social interactions (e.g., a number of Facebook ``likes'') and environmental context they are in (e.g., pollution). The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes these four QS domains as contributing to individual's Quality of Life (QoL), with health spanning across all the four domains. The collected QS data enables an individual's state and behavioral patterns to be assessed through these different QoL domains, based on which individualized feedback can be provided, in turn enabling to improve the individual's state and QoL. The evidence of causality between QS and QoL is still being established, as only data from limited cases and domains exist so far. In this chapter, we discuss the state of this evidence via a semi-systematic review of the exemplary QS practices documented in 609 QS practitioners' talks and a review of the 438 latest available personal wearable technologies enabling QS. We discuss the challenges and opportunities for the QS to become an integral part of the future of healthcare and QoL-driven solutions. Some of the opportunities include using QS technologies as different types of affordances supporting the goal-oriented actions by the individual, in turn improving their QoL.},
